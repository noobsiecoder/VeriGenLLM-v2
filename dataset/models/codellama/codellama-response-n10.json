The state machine has a clock input `clk`, a reset input `reset`, and two output registers `state` and `next_state`. The `state` register is the current state of the machine, and the `next_state` register is the next state of the machine.\n\nThe `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block is the clocked always block, which means that it is executed every time the clock edge occurs. The `if (reset)` block is executed when the reset signal is asserted, and it sets the `state` register to 0. Otherwise, the `state` register is set to the `next_state` register.\n\nThe `always @(*)` block is the combinational always block, which means that it is executed every time the inputs to the block change. The `case` statement is used to determine the next state of the machine based on the current state. The `next_state` register is set to the appropriate value based on the current state.\n\nThe `module` keyword is used to define a module, which is a collection of hardware components that can be instantiated in a design. The `ABRO_FSM` module takes three inputs: `clk`, `reset`, and `state`. The `state` input is the current state of the machine, and the `next_state` output is the next state of the machine.\n\nThe `output` keyword is used to declare an output register. The `reg` keyword is used to declare a register. The `[3:0]` syntax is used to specify the width of the register, which is 4 bits in this case.\n\nThe `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block is the clocked always block, which means that it is executed every time the clock edge occurs.

The state machine starts in the IDLE state and then transitions to the A state, then to the B state, then to the R state, and then to the O state. Finally, the state machine returns to the IDLE state.\n\nThe `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block is used to define the state machine's behavior. The `if (reset)` block is used to reset the state machine to the IDLE state when the reset signal is asserted. The `else` block is used to transition the state machine to the next state based on the current state.\n\nThe `always @(*)` block is used to define the next state logic. The `case` statement is used to determine the next state based on the current state.
